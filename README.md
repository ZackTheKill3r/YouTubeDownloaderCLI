A Console based app to Download and Stream YouTube content.

# Features
- **Fast Downloads**
  -  Although it doesn't have a good mp4 quality it sure does compensate on the spped.
- **Playlist Downloads**
  - You can download entire playlists, go ahead it's quite fun.
- **A Good lookin' CLI Interface**
  - That almost never needs to be replaced and it should run every core update.
- **Modular**
  - You can choose between updating everything, only the CLI or only the Core, although updating everything is highly recommended for stability reasons.
- **Ad Free**
  - It is and will always be.
- **Streaming** 
  - Audio/Video is now possibe, although woudn't recomend the video one since it's in a quite rough shape.

# [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
If you're thinking about using it as a .py file or building it youself, you'll have to download FFMPEG and leave at the root folder of the app.

# [Pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube)

You'll also need Pytube but don't worry! We included it on the requirements.txt so you'll just have to use: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
https://github.com/pytube/pytube

# [Youtube_dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)

And finally there's Youtube_dl this module is used by Pytube and also used on it's own to stream videos/music.
