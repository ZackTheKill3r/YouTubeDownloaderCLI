A Console based app to Download and Stream YouTube content.

# Features
- **Fast Downloads**, although it doesn't have a good mp4 quality it sure does compensate on the spped.
- **Playlist Downloads**, you can download entire playlists, go ahead it's quite fun.
- **A Good lookin' CLI Interface**, that almost never needs to be replaced and it should run every core update.
- **Modular**, you can choose between updating everything, only the CLI or only the Core, although updating everything is highly recommended for stability reasons.
- **Ad Free** It is and will always be.
- **Streaming** Audio/Video is now possibe, although woudn't recomend the video one since it's in a quite rough shape.

# FFMPEG
If you're thinking about using it as a .py file or building it youself, you'll have to download FFMPEG and leave at the root folder of the app.
Here's the download link: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
