A Console based app to Download and Stream YouTube content.

# Features
- **Fast Downloads**
  -  Although it doesn't have a good mp4 quality it sure does compensate on the spped.
- **Playlist Downloads**
  - You can download entire playlists, go ahead it's quite fun.
- **A Good lookin' CLI Interface**
  - That almost never needs to be replaced and it should run every core update.
- **Modular**
  - You can choose between updating everything, only the CLI or only the Core, although updating everything is highly recommended for stability reasons.
- **Ad Free**
  - It is and will always be.
- **Streaming** 
  - Audio/Video is now possibe, although woudn't recomend the video one since it's in a quite rough shape.

# Installation

Either install one of the releases, or clone the repository and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install all the necessary modules and be sure to install FFMPEG in the root folder of the clone and you're good to go! To update it, just replace the files with the new ones.

# [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) (Optional!)

If you're thinking about using the streaming features download ffmpeg for your OS, it's a awesome small and lightweight player.

If you're downloading from the releases you shold already have it on folder ready to go!

# [Pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube)

Litterally what this project is mostly built on! It's simple to use and has a lot of cool functions!
You'll also need Pytube but don't worry! We included it on the requirements.txt so you'll just have to use: 

# [Youtube_dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)

And finally there's Youtube_dl this module is used by Pytube and also used on it's own to stream videos/music.
