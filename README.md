A Console based app to Download and Stream YouTube content.

# Features
- **Fast Downloads**
  -  You can either let YDC choose a balanced preset between speed and quality, or you can choose your preferred quality, eitherway it should be really quick.
- **Playlist Downloads**
  - You can download entire playlists, go ahead it's quite fun.
- **A Good lookin' CLI Interface**
  - That almost never needs to be replaced and it should run every core update.
- **Ad Free**
  - It is and will always be.
- **Streaming** 
  - Audio/Video is now possibe, although woudn't recomend the video one since it's in a quite rough shape.
# Installation

Either install one of the releases, or clone the repository and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install all the necessary modules and be sure to install FFMPEG in the root folder of the clone and you're good to go! To update it, just replace the files with the new ones.

# [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) (Optional!)

If you're thinking about using the streaming features download ffmpeg for your OS, it's a awesome small and lightweight player.

If you're downloading from the releases you shold already have it on folder ready to go!

# [Pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube)

Litterally what this project is mostly built on! It's simple to use and has a lot of cool functions!
You'll also need Pytube but don't worry! We included it on the requirements.txt so you'll just have to run: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

# [Youtube_dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)
And finally there's Youtube_dl this module is used by Pytube and also used on it's own to stream videos/music.

# Translations

Now with the recently launched "The Translations Update" There's the possibility of translating YDC to almost every language in the world, all I need is your help.
If you know any language besides the ones already included and are willing to help, you can start your own translation on top of the English language file, by replacing only the words and leaving the "/" and "\n" as it is since they're placeholders to dynamic parts of the code and just line breaks. You can either send the file through here or through my Discord Kill3rZack#2574.
